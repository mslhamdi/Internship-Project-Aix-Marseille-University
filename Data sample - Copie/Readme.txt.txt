This folder contains some data sample used in the preprocessing step.

Note that if you see in the codes files that a folder is named a name then "- Copie", it means that it is the same one...
In particular, for exemple the folders: 

-"skycamera_images" and "skycamera_images - Copie" are the same.
-"preprocess_csv_files_new" and "preprocess_csv_files_new - Copie" are the same.

-->The reason behind adding that "- Copie" is to preserve the original folder from any irreversible modification...

Also,
-"skycamera22", "Data-copie\Clean" and "skycamera22-real data" are the same, i mean by this that they contain the same files.
-"csv_files_entire_data" and "csv_files" contain the same files also...

-->The reason behind using many folders that contains the same files is principaly to preserve the original folder from any irreversible modification...
